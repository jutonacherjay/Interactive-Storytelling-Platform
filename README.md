Usage
Upon loading, the user is presented with a story introduction.
The user can select between two options to decide the next step in the story.
After completing the story, the reader can view how long they spent in each section.
How It Works
The story is structured as a series of choices, each leading to a different outcome.
A JavaScript object holds the story data, and user selections guide the narrative.
Time tracking is implemented to measure how long a reader stays on each section.
